  <p style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 1em;">Yasmine Barboza sat behind a table covered in secondhand jeans and shoes hand-painted with whimsical designs. She had just finished a Zoom class on her phone when a passerby came up to buy one of her custom tote bags.<br>
  <br>Barboza, 20, channeled her love for art and vintage clothing to create Fooghou, where she takes used clothing material and upcycles it with paint, sewing and custom designs. Atop the black-and-yellow Black Lives Matter street mural at Restoration Plaza in Brooklyn, Fooghou made its in-person debut at Warriors in the Garden’s first Black Business Fair on Thursday.
<br>
<br>“It’s really about that community experience,” Barboza said. “It just feels good to be out here with other Black creatives and entrepreneurs and highlight Black creativity, Black joy.”<br>
<br>Warriors in the Garden is a New York City-based group of nonviolent activists that aims to protect its community from all systems of oppression, according to its mission statement. The group has led a number of protests against police brutality since its inception in May, but it also aims to work on the policy side of these issues to enact change. Per the event description, the Black Business Fair encourages people to buy from local Black-owned businesses in order to support their own communities instead of large corporations, many of which utilize prison labor.<br>
<br>Tables covered in colorful artwork, hand-painted clothing and homemade candles and perfumes lined the perimeter of the blocked-off street. Blu Gengo, 19, bounced around from table to table, sometimes taking a break to dance in the middle of the plaza. The Oakland, California native is now a junior at The New School and an organizer with Warriors in the Garden. Equipped with her face mask spelling out “Warrior,” Gengo explained the necessity of creating spaces that center Black people and businesses in order to level a playing field that systematically put Black people at a disadvantage.</p>

<p style="border:1px; border-style:solid; border-color:black; padding: 1em;">“It’s kind of like starting a race when you’re already a mile behind, or starting a race and you don’t even hear the gun go off,” Gengo said. “So this is kind of providing the tools so everyone can start the race at the same place.”<br>
<br>A range of businesses were present, from FIT student Tracy Johnson’s handmade rugs to 23-year-old Devonte Deshawn’s homemade fragrances and perfumes. At times, the vendors would take a break from manning their stations and visit other tables, complimenting one another’s work and exchanging contact information. The unifying attitude between all the vendors was that the Black Business Fair should be a space to foster community and peace in these chaotic times.<br>
<br>“I just want people to make my art a little safe space for themselves,” Johnson said. “I want them to be happy and feel calm when they have my work in their hands.”<br>
<br>In a far corner, attendees faced off in fitness challenges while music blared from a makeshift speaker system. Children raced by on scooters and bicycles, swerving through the crowd gathered at Restoration Plaza. Gengo smiled at the scene, proud that she could help cultivate this sense of community. She said this is the first of many Black Business Fairs that Warriors in the Garden will host.<br>
<br>“Black people and Black businesses are not being given the equity and tools they need because the injustices are built into the system,” Gengo said. “This is just a small act of trying to undo these things that have been woven into a 400-year system.”</p>
